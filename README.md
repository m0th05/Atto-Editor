# ANNOUNCMENT:
### Atto has been officially abandoned
yeah i have nothing else to say besides i have no abandoned the project, due to increased difficulty of implementing features.
atto at the current moment is now classed as complete and wont be releasing further updates from today,
however this doesnt mean that you cant contribute to atto, you can fully fork it, implement features and so on,
its just that me (Dom) wont be taking part in developing atto further than it is right now.
It has been a good run
