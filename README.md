### Atto has been kind of abandoned
i simply hit a roadblock and i dont know what to do, so for now atto is classed as "abandoned"


### Deps:

  - rust 
    
> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not have rust currently please install the rust toolchain. It can be found at crates.io @ the install cargo button.

### Binds:

pick your binds in the lua config, atto will make one on first start in a common place if it doesnt exist

pick between Atto, Nano, Micro and emacs*

*pseudo emacs

or vim mode with vim or kakoune binds

### Next steps:

So after some people used it, here is a list of a few things that people seemingly want to see:

- tree sitter
- plugins

### Install:

`git clone https://github.com/m0thman70/Atto-Editor`

`cd Atto-Editor`

`chmod +x install.sh`

`sudo ./install.sh`
