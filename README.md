> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not have rust currently please install the rust toolchain. It can be found at crates.io @ the install cargo button.

### Notes:

it works, idk what im supposed to say


### Compile:

`git clone https://github.com/m0thman70/Atto`

`cd Atto`

`cargo build --release`

`cd target/release`

`chmod +x atto`
