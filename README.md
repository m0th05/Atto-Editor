### what couldve been
well i mean it is a sad end but also not surprising at all, i dont know how to develop a "good" text editor with features that can compete with other text editors and lack of things that i genuinely cant implement like LSP and Syntax Highlighting, thats where my knoweledge and limits are sooo.... im classing the project as complete while its incomplete, might come back to it, idk but i am busy and i should just move over to a new project.

### Deps:

  - rust 
    
> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not have rust currently please install the rust toolchain. It can be found at crates.io @ the install cargo button.

### Binds:

pick your binds in the lua config, atto will make one on first start in a common place if it doesnt exist

pick between Atto, Nano, Micro and emacs*

*pseudo emacs

or vim mode with vim or kakoune binds

### Next steps:

So after some people used it, here is a list of a few things that people seemingly want to see:

- tree sitter
- plugins

### Install:

`git clone https://github.com/m0thman70/Atto-Editor`

`cd Atto-Editor`

`chmod +x install.sh`

`sudo ./install.sh`
