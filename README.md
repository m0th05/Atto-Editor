> If you do not have rust currently please install the rust toolchain. It can be found at crates.io @ the install cargo button.

### Notes:

currently its in very early stages, this is version 0.2.0 so be sure to know that there is bugs 

### Binds:

pick your binds in the lua config, alkaline will make one on first start in a common place if it doesnt exist

pick between Alkaline, Nano, Micro and emacs*

*pseudo emacs (thats something to fix for 0.3.0)

### Next steps:

So after some people used it, here is a list of a few things that people seemingly want to see:

- syntax highlighting -> possibly tree sitter
- commands -> no idea how
- a few people asked for modes but thats gonna be sidelined

### Install:

`git clone https://github.com/m0thman70/Alkaline`

`cd Alkaline`

`chmod +x install.sh`

`sudo ./install.sh`
